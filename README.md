> **I’m building AIΩN, a semantic foundation for deterministic computation where execution history is replayable, inspectable, and accountable by construction—not reconstructed after the fact.**

The **AIΩN Foundations Series** explores a radical shift in technology, asking us to imagine a computer that stops acting like a calculator and starts acting like a law of physics. Instead of random events, what if your computer’s history became a singular, unbreakable thread; a "Worldline" that allowed you to rewind the universe of your operating system to any second in the past? Crucially, do files actually need to exist at all, or could a machine reconstruct your photos and documents from thin air using nothing but logic and the principle of Computational Holography? At its deepest level, this architecture forces us to ask if a computer built out of recursive graphs, webs within webs, might eventually stop looking like code and start following the same quantum rules as the atoms in our own universe.

## Current Art

I build developer tools that eliminate entire categories of complexity.

The most powerful abstractions feel inevitable once you see them. That's what these projects do. They take genuinely complex problems (deployment provenance, schema drift, autonomous planning) and collapse them into primitives so simple they become invisible.

The most elegant solutions don't always involve inventing new tools. They're found in clever new ways of using the tools we already have. My benchmark isn't just the absence of the original problem, it's when things feel obvious, and entire categories of complexity have been eliminated. That's how you unlock a team's potential: make tools and workflows deliberately boring and out of the way.

## On Seeing Patterns

<img alt="romanesco broccoli" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e6091cf1-cc2f-4990-9b80-88c186fe10d7" align="left" width="400" />


_Fifteen years ago I was on lunch break, sitting outside in Seattle after walking through Pike Place Market..._

I'd just seen Romanesco broccoli for the first time. That fractal vegetable where each floret is a miniature copy of the whole.

I realized: nature had been doing recursive graphs for millions of years. We were just late to the party.

That insight led to [**WARP Graphs**](https://github.com/meta-graph/core) a data structure where nodes are graphs, edges are graphs, infinitely recursive. **Graphs all the way down.** The [mathematical properties](https://github.com/meta-graph/core/blob/main/docs/rmg-math.md) turn out to be universal: this structure can model computation itself.

Once you see it, you can't unsee it.

## [ECHO](https://github.com/flyingrobots/echo) – The Impossible Game Engine

<img height="350" alt="Echo" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f7b02dad-b5c3-46f5-ab6a-9aa87b477653" align="right" />

> _"Things are only impossible until they're not." — Jean-Luc Picard_

Echo is an ambitious, mind-bending, radically different computational model for interactive simulations, built on the WARP Graph (Worldline Algebra for Recursive Provenance). In this model, everything is a graph—nodes, edges, and even rewrite rules are all, recursively, graphs. It’s Graphs. All. The. Way. Down.

Where traditional engines like Unity and Unreal are built on mutable, object-oriented state machines, Echo is fundamentally built different. It replaces mutable objects with a declarative system where the engine rewrites the entire graph using deterministic, typed transformation rules.

The result is a game engine with properties previously considered impossible: perfect confluent determinism.

This powerful, category-theory-backed math eliminates network desyncs forever and makes your world rewindable, forkable, and perfectly mergable. It delivers time-travel debugging, flawless replays, and the capability to build a true multiverse.

Echo is the future of simulation. Buckle up, because things are gonna get weird.

### Ethics & Principles

I believe technology should serve humanity, not harm it.

#### [Universal Charter](https://universalcharter.org)

<img alt="Universal Charter" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/342c2a83-c05e-4272-9fac-80a353be66c8" width="200" align="right" />

Principles for coexistence between biological, artificial, and hybrid intelligences. Post-anthropocentric ethics for a world where we're not the only minds in the room.

**Status:** v1.0.0

#### [MIND-UCAL Software License](https://github.com/UniversalCharter/mind-ucal)

An ethical software license that forbids harmful uses—military weapons, surveillance, killer robots—while allowing personal, commercial, and ethical AI applications.

**No weapons. No killer robots. No evil AI.**

**Status:** v1.0

### Teaching

#### [PRAXIS: A Field Guide to the Inevitable](https://github.com/flyingrobots/praxis)

<img width="300!" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f9431369-abd1-480d-9896-6badb84f5568" align="left" />

You've been hired. The facility is expecting you.

A windowless building. A cowboy in denim who knows too much. Six systems that govern everything: the planners, the executors, the judges, the conscience, the immune system, and something that hums beneath the floor.
Your job is simple: learn the architecture. Follow the yellow line. Don't ask why your fingerprints keep appearing on glass you haven't touched.
PRAXIS is a design fiction about collective intelligence, alignment, and the moment you realize you were never outside the system observing it. Part facility tour, part horror story, part warning label—it asks what governance looks like when it 
emerges from machines the way gravity emerges from mass.

There's a red phone in a white room. It will ring.

Don't forget your badge.

#### [GitScrolls](https://github.com/gitscrolls/gitscrolls) – The Mythic Developer's Journey

" alt="tuxicles" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/58d0f341-aa91-4b7e-b8ec-a9de1e4f0e4d" align="left" />


A 16-part epic teaching Git through one developer's tragic force-push. Because the best way to learn version control is through narrative tragedy and redemption.

What happens when you git push --force your ego directly to production?

For Tuxicles, a brilliant but arrogant programmer, the answer is a disaster of epic proportions: 2.3 million broken user sessions, a betrayed community, and a one-way ticket to the Nine Circles of Developer Hell.

Now, he must navigate a hilarious and terrifying underworld where the demons are merge conflicts and the damned are trapped in infinite loops of their own bad habits. Forget everything you know about epic fantasy. To escape, Tuxicles must face the one bug he never thought to fix: himself.
