# Is the universe a deterministic graph rewrite engine, or does it just look like one because we're imperfect observers?

I build systems around [WARP graphs](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17908005): bit-perfect replay, time-travel debugging, provenance sovereignty, and [computational holography](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17963669). 

Computation is more beautiful than we’ve been told. There’s a geometry of thought and a physics of computation. With the right invariants, the structure snaps into focus, and computers become truth-powered time machines that can show us not just what happened, but what could have happened, too.

Together, let’s:

- Build time-travel debugging through deterministic replay: rewind, inspect, fork any execution
- Reveal the shape of machines: WARP graphs reveal computation’s hidden geometry
- Quantify refactor difficulty: why some code yields, and some code resists


## [AIΩN](https://github.com/flyingrobots/aion)

> THE REVΩLUTION WILL BE DETERMINISTIC  
> THE PROOF IS MATHEMATICAL, AND CONSTRUCTIVE  
> TIME WILL TELL

AIΩN is a formal framework for deterministic, history-native computation. It flips the script on traditional systems by making transformations (not states) the core unit of storage—unlocking reproducible builds, deterministic concurrency, and unbreakable provenance. Built on WARP graphs and double-pushout (DPO) rewriting, it turns computation into a verifiable, rewindable multiverse where quantum-like behaviors and time itself emerge from observer geometry.

This is the theoretical backbone of my work: a "graphs all the way down" philosophy that enables computational holography—recovering entire histories from compact boundaries. It's not just theory; it powers real tools for ethical, sovereign AI and beyond.

### [Git Stunts](https://github.com/git-stunts)

Git is the most battle-tested software on Earth. It's also secretly a primitive WARP graph.

I've created `git-stunts`, a GitHub organization that focuses on exploring Git's low-level "plumbing" to create unconventional systems. I plan on writing a blog consisting of a series of "stunts", treating Git as a foundational primitive for things like databases, content management, event buses, and more, emphasizing curiosity, first-principles engineering, and creative misuse of Git's internals to push Git to its limits. The philosophy prioritizes understanding, and is aimed at developers curious about Git's deeper mechanics. 

I'm currently busy working on the underlying core libraries that will be used to build the featured projects.

#### Planned Stunts

|------|-------|--------|-------|--------|
| I | Git as CMS | In Review, Pending Publication | Git's `commit-tree` doubles as a DB-less API | How to reduce operational complexity via protocols |
| II | Git as Key-Value Store | Planned | Offline-first KV-store using OIDs and Git notes | CAP theorem, consistency vs availability in distributed systems | 
| III | Git as Bus | Planned | Using `post-receive` hooks for serverless pub/sub | Event-driven architecture, high-reliability event delivery (within constrained domains) |
| IV | Git FUSE | Planned | FUSE-based virtualized filesystem via Git OIDs | Virtualization, Lazy-loading and on-demand hydration |
| V | Agent-Native Git | Planned | RAG and decision-tracking via Git history | AI infra, verifiable merkle trees for LLM memory |
| VI | Git as Zero-Trust Gateway | Planned | AST-validation in `pre-receive` hooks | Shift-left security, moving trust to the transport layer |
