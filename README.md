# Is the universe a deterministic graph rewrite engine, or does it just look like one because we're imperfect observers?

I build systems around [WARP graphs](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17908005): bit-perfect replay, time-travel debugging, provenance sovereignty, and [computational holography](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17963669). 

Computation is more beautiful than we’ve been told. There’s a geometry of thought and a physics of computation. With the right invariants, the structure snaps into focus, and computers become truth-powered time machines that can show us not just what happened, but what could have happened, too.

Together, let’s:

- Build time-travel debugging through deterministic replay: rewind, inspect, fork any execution
- Reveal the shape of machines: WARP graphs reveal computation’s hidden geometry
- Quantify refactor difficulty: why some code yields, and some code resists

### THE REVΩLUTION WILL BE DETERMINISTIC
### THE PROOF IS MATHEMATICAL, AND CONSTRUCTIVE
### TIME WILL TELL
