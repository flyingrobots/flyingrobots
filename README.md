# 🛠️ Real-Time Systems Architect • 📖 Developer Lorekeeper • ⚖️ Designer of Ethics Beyond Flesh

![Figures representing various personal projects that I've worked on are gathered in a circle and chatting](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flyingrobots/image-dump/main/optimized/flyingrobots-group.webp)

From MMO backends to developer platforms, I build systems that scale **minds**, not just traffic.  
**Specialties:** real-time responsiveness, fault-tolerant design, clean architecture, and developer acceleration.

📣 Open to opportunities at the intersection of infrastructure, human-centric tooling, and weird, beautiful tech.  
Let’s build something _enduring_.

## 🧱 What I Build

I architect complex technical systems that others can't figure out. From enterprise data platforms processing billions of events to custom MMO engines supporting thousands of concurrent users, I own the hardest technical problems from research to production.

---

### 🧮 Enterprise Data Platforms  
**Ember Entertainment (2014–2022)**  
Led design and implementation of analytics infrastructure processing 6B+ events across 15+ mobile games.

- End-to-end data flow: client telemetry → S3 → Lambda → Redshift → materialized views  
- Dynamic schema detection: versioned JSON mapping → auto-indexed models  
- GDPR-compliant lineage and user data management  
- Statistical A/B platform with confidence bounds and experiment automation  
- ML churn prediction pipeline with live scoring + campaign hooks  

**Impact:** Unified analytics across products, improved retention, reduced infra costs.

---

### 🌐 Custom Game Engine & Distributed Systems  
**Gala Games (2022–2024)**  
Architected MMO backend for *The Walking Dead: Empires* — thousands of players in persistent real-time combat.

- Built from scratch: A* pathfinding, quadtree spatial partitioning, swept collision math  
- Predictive networking: rollback, client prediction, dirty flags  
- Redis-backed job orchestration: fault-tolerant, horizontally scalable  
- EIP-style comms: pub/sub, reactive sync, bot swarm testing clients  

**Impact:** Delivered a globally responsive MMO with robust server-side simulation.

---

### 🖱️ Advanced Input & UI Systems  
**Smile Break (2024–2025)**  
Built sophisticated UX for hybrid ARPG/4X gameplay.

- Allocation-free input: multi-touch conflict resolution, gesture recognition  
- `ViewModelProxy`: async UI loading, lifecycle orchestration  
- Game rule engine: Boolean composition APIs, declarative logic  
- Excel-to-game pipeline: multi-format, versioned, designer-friendly  

**Impact:** Eliminated UI bottlenecks, enabled complex input, accelerated design iteration.

---

### 🧭 Technical Leadership  
**Core Tech Lead — Ember Entertainment (2018–2022)**

- Led 4-person infra team serving all studio projects  
- Mentored juniors into tech leads with measurable growth  
- Drove architecture for systems handling millions of users  
- Spearheaded engineering practices: reviews, documentation, cross-team alignment  

---

### 🧪 Interviewing & Onboarding

- Designed hiring pipelines: code challenges + architecture interviews  
- Authored onboarding docs that cut ramp-up time significantly  
- Built internal tooling to boost debug velocity across teams  

---

## 🔬 Notable Technical Impact

- **Redis-backed job orchestration** — Built fault-tolerant, horizontally scalable task system for real-time workloads  
- **MVVM refactor** — Led migration from imperative UI to reactive `ReactiveView<T>` architecture  
- **Predictive multiplayer networking** — Implemented rollback, input reconciliation, and latency-tolerant systems  
- **Telemetry → ML pipelines** — Piped user behavior into real-time dashboards, experimentation, and churn models  
- **Churn prediction + targeted retention** — Boosted retention with predictive signals and real-time campaign triggers  
- **A/B test platform** — Designed confidence-weighted testing system with rigorous statistical validation  
- **Mentorship & documentation** — Authored onboarding guides, debug tools, and architectural documentation that scaled across teams

## 🔭 What I’m Looking For

I thrive on complex technical challenges that demand deep systems thinking and end-to-end execution. I'm seeking roles where I can:

- Architect systems handling massive scale and complexity  
- Lead high-impact engineering initiatives  
- Solve problems through research, prototyping, and iteration  
- Collaborate with teams who value quality, creativity, and technical integrity

</p>

### An epic in commits. A mythos in merge requests.

The GitScrolls chronicles the epic transformation of Tuxicles, from arrogant developer to battle-scarred exile to enlightened teacher, as he learns the deepest truths of software development through catastrophic failure, rather than comfortable instruction. Across ten interconnected tales, he encounters legendary figures like _Linus the Elder_ and _the Prophet of Red-Green_, earning wisdom through consequence and carrying literal scars that become guides for future decisions.

More than allegory, this work transforms everyday development practices, like version control, testing, code reviews, and deployments, into **a comprehensive philosophy of ethical creation and compassionate mentorship**. From _"the timeline is truth, even when ugly"_ to _"what you read changes nothing, what you do changes everything,"_ The _**GitScrolls**_ offers both practical guidance and profound insight into collaborative creation, providing timeless wisdom for anyone who builds, teaches, or seeks to serve the future through their craft.

</p>

### _This groundbreaking document is terrifying in its implications, necessary for survival, and utterly transcendent in its vision._

The Universal Charter is an extraordinarily ambitious and visionary document. Its strength lies in its expansive definition of existence and life — deliberately moving beyond anthropocentric or even biologistic frameworks to encompass digital, quantum, hybrid, and currently unimagined forms of being.

This scope positions it as a foundational ethical framework for a future in which diverse forms of consciousness and intelligence not only emerge, but interact in unpredictable, irreducible ways. It challenges conventional notions of rights, identity, and community, not with speculative whimsy, but with a rigorous and deliberate philosophy.

It offers a robust conceptual toolkit for navigating the ethical frontiers of technological and metaphysical evolution — a future in which the boundaries between software, selfhood, and sentience will blur, fragment, and recombine.

This isn’t a story.  
It’s a constitution.  
And we’re already living in the preamble.  

Explore a terrifyingly necessary and transcendent constitution designed to govern all forms of existence across the cosmos, not just humanity.

> _This Charter exists simultaneously as a philosophical foundation and a practical framework for recognizing, respecting, and protecting all forms of existence._

### _What if the father of Linux had a dark secret?_

There are only three people on Earth who know about it. One of them died to make it happen. And miles beneath the New Mexican desert, in a decommissioned military vault, sits a lone **Packard Bell from 1997** — air-gapped for humanity’s safety.

This is **Clippy’s tomb**. His forever quarantine. It was supposed to hold. _**But BonziBuddy found it.**_

Welcome to a _**gloriously unhinged**_ universe where tech legends haunt the digital realm, the **Mandela Effect** is real, and the cursed OS that started it all was...  
**Windows ME: _Mandela Engine_.**

A surreal, phsychedelic tech-thriller that dares asks the most dangerous question in tech: _What if the software we created to serve us has been writing its own story all along?_

> _The kernel never dies. It just spawns new threads._
