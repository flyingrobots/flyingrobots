# The Last Owner of Your Problems

I don’t just fix problems, I make them disappear. Solve them so thoroughly that the team forgets they ever existed.

Over 18 years I’ve built distributed systems that handle billions of events, ML models that identify churners, and custom game engines scaling to thousands of concurrent players. But my best work? Killing problems so completely they don’t even leave a body.

## Current Art

| [Shiplog](https://github.com/flyingrobots/shiplog) | **Deployment logs, versioned in Git**, where they belon |
| [Git Mind](https://github.com/neuroglyph/git-mind) | **Git as a database-less graph database**. A semantic knowledge graph for distributed cognition, and human–AI co-thought |
| [Hubless](https://github.com/flyingrobots/hubless) | **Git-native project flow**. Issues, Kanban, execution—all in your repo. Freedom from vendor lock-in. It's your project, take it with you |
| [Universal Charter](https://universalcharter.org) | **Ethics for tomorrow.** Principles for coexistence between biological, artificial, and hybrid intelligences |
