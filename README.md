## Is the universe a deterministic graph rewrite engine… or does it just *look* like one because we’re imperfect observers?

I build systems around **WARP graphs**: deterministic replay, time-travel debugging, provenance sovereignty, and **computational holography**. 

If you’ve ever wanted to **rewind a system**, inspect it like a crime scene, fork it like a multiverse, and still keep the receipts—hi.

- **Deterministic replay**: rewind, inspect, fork any execution
- **Machine geometry**: make computation’s hidden structure visible
- **Refactor gravity**: measure why some code yields, and some code resists

**Key reads:**  
- WARP graphs paper: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17908005  
- Computational holography: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17963669

## What I’m building (featured)

| Project | What it is | Why it matters |
|---|---|---|
| **[AIΩN](https://github.com/flyingrobots/aion)** | Formal framework for deterministic, history-native computation | “Transforms, not states.” Replayability as a first-class invariant. |
| **[Echo](https://github.com/flyingrobots/echo)** | Real-time WARP rewrite engine (Rust) | Deterministic simulation you can rewind and fork without lying to yourself. |
| **[Git-WARP](https://github.com/git-stunts/git-warp)** | WARP graph engine on Git commits | CRDT-friendly history with deterministic replay and brutal simplicity. |
| **[xyph](https://github.com/flyingrobots/xyph)** | Reificatory Engine | Xyph it done. |
| **[git-mind](https://github.com/flyingrobots/git-mind)** | Semantic knowledge graph on Git | Version your thoughts. Branch ideas. Merge understanding. |

## AIΩN

AIΩN treats computation as a **verifiable rewrite process**: transformations are the primary artifact, not ephemeral state.

Built on WARP graphs and **double-pushout (DPO) rewriting**, it turns execution into a rewindable, forkable history with provenance you can actually trust.

It’s “graphs all the way down” with a practical goal: **systems that can explain themselves**. What happened, why, and what would’ve happened if we’d chosen differently.

### AIΩN Applied

- **[CΩMPUTER](https://github.com/flyingrobots/aion-computer-book)** — book-in-progress: computation as base reality  
- **[Continuum OS](https://github.com/flyingrobots/continuum)** — causal runtime + holographic artifacts *(very early)*

## Git Stunts

Git is the most battle-tested software on Earth.  
It’s also—quietly **a primitive WARP graph**.

I run **[git-stunts](https://github.com/git-stunts)**: projects that treat Git plumbing as a foundation for unconventional systems—databases, content graphs, event buses, coordination protocols.

### Planned Stunts

| Part | Title | Status | Stunt | Lesson |
|------|-------|--------|-------|--------|
| I | Git as CMS | In Review | `commit-tree` as a DB-less API | Protocols reduce ops |
| II | Git as KV Store | Planned | KV using OIDs + notes | CAP tradeoffs in the real world |
| III | Git as Bus | Planned | `post-receive` hooks for pub/sub | Eventing under constraints |
| IV | Git FUSE | Planned | Virtual filesystem via OIDs | Lazy hydration + virtualization |
| V | Agent-Native Git | Planned | RAG + decisions via history | Verifiable memory for LLM work |
| VI | Git as Zero-Trust Gateway | Planned | AST validation in hooks | Shift-left security at the transport |

Follow along for some hot git 🔥 (and occasional self-inflicted pain).
