## The Last Owner of Your Problems

I don’t just fix problems, I make them disappear. I solve them so thoroughly the team forgets they ever existed.

Over my 18-year career I’ve built distributed systems that handle billions of events, ML models that identify churners, and custom game engines scaling to thousands of concurrent players. 

I love working across disciplines, solving problems before teams even know they have them, and building technology that empowers, unlocks, and multiplies an organization's potential.
