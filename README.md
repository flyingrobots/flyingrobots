# Senior Distributed Systems Engineer

I’ve spent nearly two decades building production distributed systems, MMO backends, data platforms, DevOps pipelines, high-throughput event systems, custom engines, and infrastructure that had to survive reality.

After years of debugging race conditions, chasing nondeterminism, and watching mutable state systems lie under pressure, I started asking a more fundamental question:

What if computation wasn’t about state at all?

What if it was about *structure evolving through rules*?

---

## WARP Graphs: _Worldline Algebra for Recursive Provenance_

Modern systems are not really "state machines." They are evolving graphs of relationships.

If we treat them that way, literally, and build around rewrite rules instead of mutable state, we gain something powerful:

- **Always-on time travel debugging**
- **Bit-perfect determinism across platforms**
- **Complete system-wide provenance**
- **Lockless concurrency where race conditions are impossible by construction**

This is the foundation of the systems I build. I formalize this model as **WARP graphs**, a deterministic rewrite substrate for replayable, inspectable computation.

This GitHub is where I publish the systems that emerge from that idea.

### I ❤️ Git

Git is the most battle-tested software on Earth.  

It’s also _quietly_ **a primitive WARP graph**.

I run a GitHub organization called **[git-stunts](https://github.com/git-stunts)**, where I publish projects that treat Git plumbing as a foundation for unconventional systems—databases, content graphs, event buses, coordination protocols. 

These are **stunts**, _not hacks_: deliberate and grounded in how Git really works. These projects are about understanding tools deeply enough that surprising architectures emerge naturally. 

The ability to deconstruct a system to its primitives is one of the most valuable skills in an engineer's toolkit. Often, the most elegant solutions come from looking at the tools we use every day and asking _"What else can this thing do?"_

### Planned Stunts

| Part | Title | Status | Stunt | Lesson |
|------|-------|--------|-------|--------|
| I | Git as CMS | In Review | `commit-tree` as a DB-less API | Protocols reduce ops |
| II | Git as KV Store | Planned | KV using OIDs + notes | CAP tradeoffs in the real world |
| III | Git as Bus | Planned | `post-receive` hooks for pub/sub | Eventing under constraints |
| IV | Git FUSE | Planned | Virtual filesystem via OIDs | Lazy hydration + virtualization |
| V | Agent-Native Git | Planned | RAG + decisions via history | Verifiable memory for LLM work |
| VI | Git as Zero-Trust Gateway | Planned | AST validation in hooks | Shift-left security at the transport |

Follow along for some hot git 🔥 (and occasional self-inflicted pain).

## Is the universe a deterministic graph rewrite engine… or does it just *look* like one because we’re imperfect observers?

The sections above describe the engineering intuition. Below are the formal foundations and working systems that implement it.

| Project | What it is | Why it matters |
|---|---|---|
| **[AIΩN](https://github.com/flyingrobots/aion)** | Formal framework for deterministic, history-native computation | “Transforms, not states.” Replayability as a first-class invariant. |
| **[Echo](https://github.com/flyingrobots/echo)** | Real-time WARP rewrite engine (Rust) | Deterministic simulation you can rewind and fork without lying to yourself. |
| **[Git-WARP](https://github.com/git-stunts/git-warp)** | WARP graph engine on Git commits | CRDT-friendly history with deterministic replay and brutal simplicity. |
| **[xyph](https://github.com/flyingrobots/xyph)** | Reificatory Engine | Xyph compiles structure from intent, transforming a Git repository into an human/agent squadron HQ. |
| **[git-mind](https://github.com/flyingrobots/git-mind)** | Semantic knowledge graph on Git | Version your thoughts. Branch ideas. Merge understanding. |

AIΩN treats computation as a **verifiable rewrite process**: transformations are the primary artifact, not ephemeral state.

Built on WARP graphs and **double-pushout (DPO) rewriting**, it turns execution into a rewindable, forkable history with provenance you can actually trust.

It’s “graphs all the way down” with a practical goal: **systems that can explain themselves**. What happened, why, and what would’ve happened if we’d chosen differently.
