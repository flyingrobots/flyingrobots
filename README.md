# 🛠️ Real-Time Systems Architect • 📖 Author of Narrative Systems for Developer Growth • ⚖️ Framework for Post-Anthropocentric Ethics

From MMO backends to distributed developer platforms, I build systems that scale minds, not just traffic.  
**Focus:** real-time responsiveness, fault-tolerant design, clean architecture, and developer acceleration.

📣 I'm exploring new opportunities — especially those at the intersection of infrastructure, developer experience, and future-facing tech. Let’s build something enduring.

## 🧠 Recent Impact

- **Designed and deployed** a Redis-backed distributed job system with locking primitives and state orchestration—enabled scalable real-time workloads  
- **Led** MVVM refactor replacing imperative UI with a reactive architecture—eliminated boilerplate and introduced declarative `ReactiveView<T>` patterns to boost dev velocity and long-term maintainability  
- **Built** predictive input reconciliation for real-time collaboration—leveraged server-authoritative state to anticipate and correct interactions across latency and packet loss  
- **Engineered** behavioral telemetry pipelines—fed real-time dashboards, experimentation systems, and ML models for product insights  
- **Developed** churn prediction models tied to live telemetry—drove targeted retention strategies with measurable ROI  
- **Architected** confidence-weighted A/B platform with rigorous statistical modeling—validated features and drove feature-linked revenue growth  
- **Authored** onboarding playbooks and architectural guides—standardized design patterns, clarified complex systems, and scaled team productivity
