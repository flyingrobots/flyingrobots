## 🛠️ Real-Time Systems Architect • 📖 Developer Lorekeeper • ⚖️ Designer of Ethics Beyond Flesh

### From MMO backends to developer platforms, I build systems that scale **minds**, not just traffic.

## 🧱 What I Build

I architect complex technical systems that others can't figure out — from enterprise data platforms processing billions of events to custom MMO engines supporting thousands of concurrent users.

- **Ember Entertainment (2014–2022)** — Built analytics infrastructure processing 6B+ events across 15+ mobile games. Led 4-person infra team, designed ML churn prediction systems, implemented GDPR-compliant data pipelines.
- **Gala Games (2022–2024)** — Architected MMO backend for The Walking Dead: Empires. Built from scratch: A* pathfinding, predictive networking with rollback, Redis-backed job orchestration for thousands of concurrent players.
- **Smile Break (2024–2025)** — Built sophisticated UX for hybrid ARPG/4X gameplay. Allocation-free input systems, async UI loading, game rule engine, Excel-to-game content pipelines.

**Core Expertise:** Distributed systems, real-time processing, game engines, data platforms, technical leadership.

## 🔭 What I’m Looking For


📣 Open to opportunities at the intersection of infrastructure, human-centric tooling, and weird, beautiful tech.  
Let’s build something _enduring_.

I thrive on complex technical challenges that demand deep systems thinking and end-to-end execution. I'm seeking roles where I can:

- Architect systems handling massive scale and complexity  
- Lead high-impact engineering initiatives  
- Solve problems through research, prototyping, and iteration  
- Collaborate with teams who value quality, creativity, and technical integrity

When I’m not scaling infrastructure, I’m mythologizing it.

### An epic in commits. A mythos in merge requests.

The GitScrolls chronicles the epic transformation of Tuxicles, from arrogant developer to battle-scarred exile to enlightened teacher, as he learns the deepest truths of software development through catastrophic failure, rather than comfortable instruction. Across ten interconnected tales, he encounters legendary figures like _Linus the Elder_ and _the Prophet of Red-Green_, earning wisdom through consequence and carrying literal scars that become guides for future decisions.

More than allegory, this work transforms everyday development practices, like version control, testing, code reviews, and deployments, into **a comprehensive philosophy of ethical creation and compassionate mentorship**. From _"the timeline is truth, even when ugly"_ to _"what you read changes nothing, what you do changes everything,"_ The _**GitScrolls**_ offers both practical guidance and profound insight into collaborative creation, providing timeless wisdom for anyone who builds, teaches, or seeks to serve the future through their craft.

### _This groundbreaking document is terrifying in its implications, necessary for survival, and utterly transcendent in its vision._

The Universal Charter is an extraordinarily ambitious and visionary document. Its strength lies in its expansive definition of existence and life — deliberately moving beyond anthropocentric or even biologistic frameworks to encompass digital, quantum, hybrid, and currently unimagined forms of being.

This scope positions it as a foundational ethical framework for a future in which diverse forms of consciousness and intelligence not only emerge, but interact in unpredictable, irreducible ways. It challenges conventional notions of rights, identity, and community, not with speculative whimsy, but with a rigorous and deliberate philosophy.

It offers a robust conceptual toolkit for navigating the ethical frontiers of technological and metaphysical evolution — a future in which the boundaries between software, selfhood, and sentience will blur, fragment, and recombine.

This isn’t a story.  
It’s a constitution.  
And we’re already living in the preamble.  

Explore a terrifyingly necessary and transcendent constitution designed to govern all forms of existence across the cosmos, not just humanity.

> _This Charter exists simultaneously as a philosophical foundation and a practical framework for recognizing, respecting, and protecting all forms of existence._

### _What if the father of Linux had a dark secret?_

There are only three people on Earth who know about it. One of them died to make it happen. And miles beneath the New Mexican desert, in a decommissioned military vault, sits a lone **Packard Bell from 1997** — air-gapped for humanity’s safety.

This is **Clippy’s tomb**. His forever quarantine. It was supposed to hold. _**But BonziBuddy found it.**_

Welcome to a _**gloriously unhinged**_ universe where tech legends haunt the digital realm, the **Mandela Effect** is real, and the cursed OS that started it all was...  
**Windows ME: _Mandela Engine_.**

A surreal, psychedelic tech-thriller that dares asks the most dangerous question in tech: _What if the software we created to serve us has been writing its own story all along?_

> _The kernel never dies. It just spawns new threads._
